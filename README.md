# week4challenge
This week you are required to develop a command line application that consumes the News API.
Project requirements
User is offered a list of four news sources.
User should be able to make a choice of a preferred news source.
User gets back a list of the top 10 headlines from the preferred source. A news headline should have a title, description and a url in case the user needs to follow up on the news story.

You are expected to use the knowledge acquired in last weekâ€™s challenges to creatively accomplish the project. Feel free to add  more features to the application and following a Test Driven approach is highly encouraged.
